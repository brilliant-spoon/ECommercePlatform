# ECommercePlatform Microservices Architecture

## Overview

ECommercePlatform is a microservices-based eCommerce solution built to demonstrate the principles of a scalable, maintainable, and resilient system. This platform consists of several independent services that communicate with each other over HTTP/REST and are deployed in a containerized environment using Docker and Kubernetes.

## Architecture

The platform is designed using a microservices architecture, where each service is responsible for a specific domain or functionality within the eCommerce platform. The services are loosely coupled, allowing independent deployment, scaling, and development.

### Services

1. **Orders Service** (`OrdersService`): Manages customer orders, including creation, updating, deletion, and retrieval of orders.
2. **Products Service** (`ProductsService`): Handles product catalog management, including CRUD operations on products.
3. **Users Service** (`UsersService`): Manages user accounts, authentication, and user data.
4. **Payments Service** (`PaymentsService`): Manages payment processing and transactions.
5. **Inventory Service** (`InventoryService`): Manages inventory levels, stock updates, and related operations.

### Infrastructure

- **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices.
- **Service Discovery**: Facilitates the dynamic discovery of services within the environment.
- **Database**: Each microservice has its own dedicated database to ensure data encapsulation and independence.
- **Message Broker**: Facilitates asynchronous communication between services using a messaging queue (e.g., RabbitMQ).

### Tech Stack

- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core, C#, Entity Framework Core
- **Frontend**: Angular (in the `angular` folder)
- **Database**: SQL Server
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (in the `k8s` folder)
- **Version Control**: Git

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) (minikube or a cloud provider)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ECommercePlatform.git
   cd ECommercePlatform
   ```

2. **Initialize Git in Each Service:**

   ```bash
   cd OrdersService
   git init
   cd ../ProductsService
   git init
   ...
   ```

3. **Build and Run Services:**

   Each service can be built and run independently:

   ```bash
   cd OrdersService
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

   For Docker:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Run the Frontend:**

   Navigate to the `angular` folder:

   ```bash
   cd angular
   npm install
   ng serve
   ```

5. **Deploy to Kubernetes:**

   Deploy the services using Kubernetes manifests:

   ```bash
   cd k8s
   kubectl apply -f deployments/
   ```

## Development

### Adding a New Microservice

1. **Create a New Folder for the Service:**

   ```bash
   mkdir NewService
   cd NewService
   dotnet new webapi -n NewService
   ```

2. **Implement Service Logic and Tests:**

   Develop the necessary endpoints and business logic, then add unit tests in the `NewService.Tests` project.

3. **Containerize the Service:**

   Add a `Dockerfile` in the `NewService` folder and build the image:

   ```dockerfile
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 AS base
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 AS build
   WORKDIR /src
   COPY . .
   RUN dotnet build -c Release -o /app
   FROM build AS publish
   RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o /app
   FROM base AS final
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=publish /app .
   ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "NewService.dll"]
   ```

4. **Add Kubernetes Deployment:**

   Create a deployment file in the `k8s/deployments` folder:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: newservice-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 2
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: newservice
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: newservice
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: newservice
           image: newservice:latest
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
   ```

### Version Control

- **Commit Changes:**

  Regularly commit your changes to keep the repository up-to-date.

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add new feature/service"
  git push origin main
  ```

- **Branching Strategy:**

  Follow Gitflow or another branching strategy that suits your team's workflow.

## Deployment

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Configure CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Azure DevOps to automate testing, building, and deployment.

### Monitoring and Logging

Integrate logging and monitoring tools like ELK Stack, Prometheus, and Grafana to ensure the health and performance of the platform.

## SOLID Principles

This project adheres to SOLID principles to ensure that the codebase is maintainable, scalable, and testable. Here's how they apply:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each microservice has a single responsibility. For example, the OrdersService only deals with order management.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Services are designed to be extensible without modifying existing code. New features can be added by extending the service.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Wherever possible, services and classes can be replaced with their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Microservices expose minimal interfaces and APIs that clients need, avoiding unnecessary dependencies.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Services depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete implementations, allowing for easy swapping of implementations (e.g., switching from SQL Server to PostgreSQL).
